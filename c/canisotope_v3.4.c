  Canisotope is a member of the CANOAK family of models.

  The original isotope version of CANOAK was developed in collaboration with
  Dave Bowling, Universtiy of Utah.
  
  This version includes extensions and updates of Alexander Knohl (ETH Zurich)
  and Matthias Cuntz (MPI-BGC Jena).

  -------------------------------------------------

  CANOAK:

  CANOAK is a coupled biophysical and ecophysiolgical model that
  computes fluxes of water, heat and CO2 exchange within vegetation
  canopies and between the canopy and the atmosphere. In doing so CANOAK
  computes the canopy microclimate (light, wind, temperature, humidity and
  CO2), which provides drivers for physiological processes such as photosynthesis,
  respiration, transpiration and stomatal conductance. The canopy is divided into
  40 layers and at each layer the energy balance, photosynthesis, transpiration,
  stomatal conductance and respiration of sunlit and shaded leaves is computed.
  Stomatal conductance is computed using a model that is linked to photosynthesis.


  The mechanistic and biochemical photosynthesis model of Farquhar is used to scale
  leaf CO2 exchange to the canopy.

  Stomatal conductance is computed using the Ball-Berry routine, that
  is dependent on leaf photosynthesis, relative humidity and the
  CO2 concentration at the leaf's surface.

  Photosynthesis and stomatal conductance are computed using a
  cubic analytical solution I developed from the coupled models
  during my stay in Viterbo, 92/93 (Baldocchi, 1994).

  Photosynthetic parameters (Vcmax and Jmax) are scaled
  with height according to specific leaf weight. SLW is a
  surrogate for the effect of leaf nitrogen on these parameters.
  Kinetic photosynthetic coefficients are derived from Peter
  Harley's 1992 field measurements at WBW. For the seasonal runs Vcmax and
  Jmax are scaled to seasonal changes in leaf area index.

  This model calculates isoprene emissions from the forest canopy using
  algorithms by Guenther.

  Turbulent diffusion is based on Lagrangian theory. A dispersion matrix is
  calculated from the random walk algorithm of Thomson (from program MOVTHM.C).
  The dispersion matrix is scaled according to u*. The dispersion matrix also
  scales with stability, since it is dependent on sigma w and sigma w depends on z/L.
  Dispersion matrices's functional dependence on stability have been derived by
  regression against 5 stability classes.

  Light profiles are computed on the basis of layers with constant
  DELTA Z to be compatible with the meteorological model. Clumping of
  foliage is consider via use of the Markov model for the probability
  of beam penetration. The penetration and scattering routines of Norman (1979) are
  used, these use a slab, one dimensional 'adding' method for scattering.
  The probability of sunlit leaf area is computed using the
  Markov model which introduces a clumping factor to the
  Poisson eq.


  Feedbacks are considered between the source sink function,
  which is a function of C, and the dispersed concentration field,
  which is a function of sources and sinks.

  Solar elevation is computed with the algorithm of Welgraven

  Soil energy balance and heat fluxes are computed using a
  numerical solution to the Fourier heat transfer equation.
  after Campbell.

  Analytical (quadratic) solutions are used for the leaf and soil surface energy balances

  Overall the model requires simple environmental inputs. Solar
  radiation, wind speed, air temperature, humidity, CO2 and a
  deep 32 cm soil temperature, at least, are needed to calculate
  fluxes. Of course parameters describing leaf area, height and
  physiological capacity of the vegetation are needed, but these
  are canopy specific.


  This version computes fluxes over the course of an annual cycle using hourly
  data from Walker Branch Watershed. Inputs include meteorological data and seasonal
  adjustment of leaf area index and photosynthetic capacity. Respiration and electron
  transport rates are scaled with Vcmax, which is a function of leaf nitrogen and depth
  in the canopy.

  and stomatal conductance models. Tree Physiology 14: 1069-1079.

  DEBUGGING NOTES

  October 2007, ak, mc
    - included water cycle
      % interception water
      % soil water (optional)
      % litter water (optional)
    - included water isotopes (optional)
      % ISOLSM - but changed percolation in soil, and changed surface fluxes
    - update 13C-formulation
    - LAI input file (optional)
    - photosynthetic parameter in two canopy layers (optional)
    - new parameter file format
    - only C (no C++), C99 standard; tested on Microsoft Visual C++ and GCC compilers
      the gcc call is: gcc -O3 -lm -x c -std=c99 -o caniso canisotope_v3.4.cpp

  September 2006,ak
  leaf photosynthesis and stomata conductance is now calculated from an analytical solution of the Farquhar model for
  photosynthesis including mesophyll conductance and the Leuning Ball Berry equation for stomata conductance

  August 2006, ak
  diffuse radiation can either be calculated or can come from measurements (input file). Have to check diffuse radiation
  routine since modelled diffuse radiation does not fit well with measurements.

  August 2006, ak
  ustar and z/L are now calculated based on actual measurement height, canopy height, displacement height and roughness length, not fixed parameters

  Jan 2006 ,ak
  soil temperature are now initiatlised with soil temperature from last time step (memory effect)

  Sept 2005, ak
  new routines for soil water added (based on LSM)

  7-6-2004, ak
  Parameter are read in from external file (parameter_file) in same directory. These parameters overwrite default values.
  source code is changed from C to C++ (*.c to *.cpp) to allow object oriented programming.

  12-5-2002
  Changed Dispersion matrix to account for the exponential decrease in sigma w and to use
  the Tl model of Massman and Weil, which considers canopy structure better. It produces a profile
  of Tl that increase with depth, like my data, and produces a relatively constant length scale.
  This makes better sense as L in the canopy is large and scales with the canopy shear length scale,
  eg h, and is representative of large scale coherent eddies.

  7-15-2002. Need to consider diffusion of 13C across the boundary layer, explicitly.

  Found I am using constant diffusivities, irrespective of temperature and pressure, based on
  data from Monteith and Unsworth at 20 C.

  Modified code and adopt reference values of Massman (1998) and am correcting diffusivities for
  temperature and pressure

  added diffuse_par/par as an output

  4-18-2002. Ready to submit paper to journal, but noticed some inconsistancies with R= C13/(C12+C13).
  Also found an error in pdb_CO2. It is 0.01115, not 0.011115. New version has been tested and with
  proper changes, there was only a small change in values. Keeling plot intercept even improved.

  3-28-2002 calling measured CO2 at 44 m on D196
  evaluating del 13C with different functions for day and night
  found algebraic error in recycling calculation

  3-26-2002. I think the signs may be wrong for Fiso. To be consistent with the up and down direction
  of fluxes I am introducing (-)Acan into Fiso

  3-25-2002. Need to average daily Ps for periods when it is not zero. Also computing daily
  ave D13.

  2-28-2002 Found new calcs of recycle are inconsistant with old files. Need to average the layer
  by layer calculations. Now having problems trying to find best way to express it and interpret
  variables in the Yakir and Sternberg Eq.

  2-26- 2002 Sensitivity run with sigma0 =0.3 rather than 0.15 on Dispersion matrix

  2-18-2002 Running with CO2 = 370 ppm based on day values of Bowling, rather than 360

  12-12-2001 Turn off soil respiration; *.resp

  12-6-2001 Sensitivity Run with Vcmax set at 50 umol m-2 s-1

  11/19/2001 Making sure changes to Cansens_v2 have been made to this code.

  found error in Dij function. It should be f=(a+x)/(b+c x)

  6-25-2001 Added the Daaman and Simmonds convection effects to soil resistances.
  Also keeping rh at soil surface too high. Using RH of air to deduce if the soil
  surface may be wet. Then vpdfact=1, else 0.1, like the Canpond simulations.

  Found unit error in the vpd at the soil. Plus it was using the ea at the top of the canopy
  rather than near the soil, as a reference value. Also we need to adjust the vpdsoil factor
  for wet and dry soils. I am assuming the soil is wet if RH is above some level, eg 95%.
  Then vpdfact is one. Otherwise the vpdfact is 0.1, like the test for the Pipo in Oregon.

  6-23-2001. Need to incorporate Daaman and Simmons routines for soil resistances, like
  Canpond. At present soil evaporation is too large during the winter. Thought I had put these
  routines in, but did not.

  6-25-2001. Sorted out the PS root problem and found some errors on the soil evaporation
  routine. Had wrong units and wrong variable for soil Energy balance. Also added Daamen
  and Simmons routine to soil energy. Need to fix this code yet.

  6/17/2001. Fixed minor LAI profiling error
  Incorporated changes in the Photosynthesis routine catch the right roots

  6/7/2001: Be careful. Getting obscenely large Ps values with new root correction

  4/12/2001 Fixed conditional statement in PS().
  Was: if (ROOT1=ROOT2).
  Fixed to: if (ROOT1==ROOT2)


  add recycling to profiles; these need debugging or need to be dropped as
  negative values occur and I am not considering the transfer of air from above
  correctly

  4/11/2001

  Adding computations of recycling of Co2 according to Sternberg

  3/29/2001

  Code is compute photosynthesis weighted D13 and the Keeling int are agreeing with data
  from Bowling.

  Computing fraction of air from soil

  3/23/2001

  Compute Flux weighted D13

  Computing what the assimilated discrimination, R, was to use to respire the next day
  to assess the isotope discrimination of the respired CO2

  3/21/2001

  The current version gives a linear Keeling plot and the intercept is -26 per mill
  the soil value!!


  3/20/2001 Bole.resp was in mg m-2 s-1 and was being added to the source which
  I had converted to umol m-2 s-1. I was also not converting the bole respiration
  to 13C fluxes. This may be one reason Isotopes were getting screwed up in the canopy

  3/13/2001 Redoing the Dij using the algorithm of Massman and Weil. Recomputed
  Dij function for z/L

  Debugging ISOTOPE and CONC

  found that I needed to adjust the CO2 profile by the factor ma/mc rhoair_mole_m-3
  to convert from mole -3 to umol

  Need to make sure 13C and 12C or (12C + 13C) cancel.

  3/12/2001 Got Isotope model running


  2-23-2001 add info on wj and wc profiles

  1-7-2001

  found met.zl was set to zero in CONC for neutral run of dispersion matrix. need to
  turn it off here and in canoak!

  1-2-2001
  Be careful on reading data with C++ compiler. I was getting warning
  errors using floats, so I changed everything to double. When I did this
  the input structure and Dispersion matrices were read in as garbage.
  I had to change those variables back to float and then they read ok!

  NEED TO BE CAREFUL ON ISOTOPES AS MANY OF THE CO2 SOURCE SINKS WERE
  IN UNITS OF MG M-2 S-1. WANT TO BE IN UNITS OF MICROMOLES M-2 S-1

  NEED TO ASSIGN RS TO F(PAR) ONLY THE FIRST ITERATION ON SUN AND
  SHADE LEAVES. AT PRESENT IT IS BEING RESET TO F(PAR) EVERY
  LOOP

  12-28-2000

  converting global variables over to structures

     Describe canopy attributes

     Flow chart of the Main Program:

     1a) start run at beginning of year
     1b) establish new LAI
     1c) Compute continuous distrib of height at a function of lai
     1d) Set soil parameters

     2) input met values

     3) Compute solar elevation angle;

     4) Compute PAR and NIR profiles and their flux densities on
     the sunlit and shaded leaf fractions

     5) Compute sunlit and shaded leaf fractions

     6) Compute first estimate of stomatal conductance

     7) Compute first estimate of IRFLUX assuming leaf temperature
     equals air temperature.
     8) Compute first estimate of leaf energy balance and leaf
     temperature

     9) Compute photosynthesis, transpiration

     10) Compute soil energy balance

     11) update computation of friction velocity with new H and z/L

     12) Compute new scalar and source/sink profiles for CO2, T and e

  The ENERGY_AND_CARBON_FLUXES routine to computes coupled fluxes

  are performed for each layer in the canopy and on the sunlit and shaded fractions.

  Analytical solution for leaf energy balance and leaf temperature is used. The program
  is derived from work by Paw U (1986) and was corrected for errors with a re-derivation
  of the equations. The quadratic form of the solution is used, rather than the quartic
  version that Paw U prefers.

  Estimates of leaf temperature are used to adjust kinetic coefficients for enzyme kinetics,
  respiration and photosynthesis, as well as the saturation vapor pressure at the leaf surface.

  The Analytical solution of the coupled set of equations for photosynthesis and stomatal
  conductance by Baldocchi (1994, Tree Physiology) is used. This equation is a solution to
  a cubic form of the photosynthesis equation. The photosynthesis algorithms are from the
  model of Farquhar. Stomatal conductance is based on the algorithms of Ball-
  Berry and Collatz et al., which couple gs to A

    because it occurs from both sides of a leaf.

    This program solves a cubic equation to calculate
    leaf photosynthesis. This cubic expression is derived from solving
    five simultaneous equations for A, PG, cs, CI and GS.
    Stomatal conductance is computed with the Ball-Berry model.
    The cubic derivation assumes that b', the intercept of the Ball-Berry
    stomatal conductance model, is non-zero.

    Gs = k A rh/cs + b'

    We also found that the solution for A can be obtained by a quadratic equation
    when Gs is constant or b' is zero.

    The derivation is published in:

    Baldocchi, D.D. 1994. An analytical solution for coupled leaf photosynthesis
    and stomatal conductance models. Tree Physiology 14: 1069-1079.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    A Biochemical Model of C3 Photosynthesis

    After Farquhar, von Caemmerer and Berry (1980) Planta.
    149: 78-90.

    The original program was modified to incorporate functions and parameters
    derived from gas exchange experiments of Harley, who paramertized Vc and J in
    terms of optimal temperature, rather than some reference temperature, eg 25C.

    Program calculates leaf photosynthesis from biochemical parameters

    rd25 - Dark respiration at 25 degrees C (umol m-2 s-1)
    tlk - leaf temperature, Kelvin
    jmax - optimal rate of electron transport
    vcopt - maximum rate of RuBP Carboxylase/oxygenase
    iphoton - incident photosynthetically active photon flux (mmols m-2 s-1)

    note: Harley parameterized the model on the basis of incident PAR

    gs - stomatal conductance (mols m-2 s-1), typically 0.01-0.20
    pstat-station pressure, bars
    aphoto - net photosynthesis (umol m-2 s-1)
    ps - gross photosynthesis (umol m-2 s-1)
    aps - net photosynthesis (mg m-2 s-1)
    aphoto (umol m-2 s-1)

    --------------------------------------------------

    iphoton is radiation incident on leaves

    The temperature dependency of the kinetic properties of
    RUBISCO are compensated for using the Arrhenius and
    Boltzmann equations. From biochemistry, one observes that
    at moderate temperatures enzyme kinetic rates increase
    with temperature. At extreme temperatures enzyme
    denaturization occurs and rates must decrease.

    Arrhenius Eq.

    f(T)=f(tk_25) exp(tk -298)eact/(298 R tk)), where eact is the
    activation energy.

    Boltzmann distribution

    F(T)=tboltz()

    Define terms for calculation of gross photosynthesis, PG

    PG is a function of the minimum of RuBP saturated rate of
    carboxylation, Wc, and the RuBP limited rate of carboxylation, Wj.
    Wj is limiting when light is low and electron transport, which
    re-generates RuBP, is limiting. Wc is limiting when plenty of RuBP is
    available compared to the CO2 that is needed for carboxylation.

    Both equations take the form:

    PG-photorespiration= (a CI-a d)/(e CI + b)

    PG-photorespiration=min[Wj,Wc] (1-gamma/Ci)

    Wc=Vcmax Ci/(Ci + Kc(1+O2/Ko))

    Wj=J Ci/(4 Ci + 8 gamma)

    Ps kinetic coefficients from Harley at WBW.

    Gamma is the CO2 compensation point

    Jan 14, 1999 Updated the cubic solutions for photosynthesis. There are
    times when the restriction that R^2 < Q^3 is violated. I therefore need
    alternative algorithms to solve for the correct root.

  /*
  This subroutine, ISOTOPE, computes concentrations of 13C
  It was developed in collaboration with David Bowling (circa Dec, 2000).

  This program computes fluxes as 13C/(13C+12C)

  We apply the algorithm of Farquhar et al that computes D13 as a function of Ci/Ca.
  Ci/Ca is computed using the photosynthesis, respiration and leaf energy balance algorithms
  of CANOAK. The Farquhar photosynthesis model is coupled to the Ball-Berry stomatal conductance
  model.

  A Lagrangian random walk model is used to compute the turbulence Dispersion matrix
  and compute concentration profiles in and above the canopy. This scheme accounts
  for counter gradient transfer.
   
  Summary of variables computed:
    Isotopic discrimination due to photosynthesis and diffusion
    D13(big Delta) = a + (b-a) ci/ca
    a is fractionation by diffusion, 4.4 per mill
    b is net fractionation by carboxylation, typically 27 per mill
    Isotopic discrimination in term of the isotopic content of the air and plant
    D13 = (d13_air - d13_plant)/(1+d13_plant)
    D13 = (Rair/Rplant-1) 1000
    D13 = alpha -1
    Rplant = Rair/(D13+1)
    Isotopic content relative to the PeeDee Standard
    d13_plant(little delta)= (Rplant/Rpdb-1) * 1000 (per mill)
    d13_air(little delta)= (Rair/Rpdb-1) * 1000 (per mill)
    Rpdb_13 = 0.01124 (13C/12C; Farquhar et al. 1989) or
    Rpdb_12_13 = 0.01115 (13C/(12C+13C), Tans et al)
    The ratio Rpdb_13/Rpdb_12_13 = 1.00807. It can be used as a multiplier to convert the
      isotopic ratio.
    alpha= Rair/Rplant
    photosynthetic flux of 13C= A*Ra/(1+D13) = A * Rplant

   * use tridiagonal system of equations to solve one-dimensional water balance:

   * d wat
   * dz ----- = -qi + qo - s
   * dt

   * with q = -k d(psi+z)/dz = -k (d psi/dz + 1) and with s=0
   * this is the Richards equation for vertical water flow

   * d wat d d wat d psi
   * ----- = -- [ k(----- ----- + 1) ]
   * dt dz dz d wat

   * where: wat = volume of water per volume of soil (mm**3/mm**3)
   * psi = soil matrix potential (mm)
   * dt = time step (s)
   * z = depth (mm)
   * dz = thickness (mm)
   * qi = inflow at top (mm h2o /s) (+ = up, - = down)
   * qo = outflow at bottom (mm h2o /s) (+ = up, - = down)
   * s = source/sink flux (mm h2o /s) (+ = loss, - = gain)
   * k = hydraulic conductivity (mm h2o /s)

   * solution: linearize k and psi about d wat and use tridiagonal system
   * of equations to solve for d wat, where for layer i
   * r_i = a_i [d wat_i-1] + b_i [d wat_i] + c_i [d wat_i+1]
