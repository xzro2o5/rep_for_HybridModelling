Canisotope is a member of the CANOAK family of models.

The original isotope version of CANOAK was developed in collaboration with
Dave Bowling, Universtiy of Utah.

This version includes extensions and updates of Alexander Knohl (ETH Zurich)
and Matthias Cuntz (MPI-BGC Jena).

-------------------------------------------------

CANOAK:

CANOAK is a coupled biophysical and ecophysiolgical model that
computes fluxes of water, heat and CO2 exchange within vegetation
canopies and between the canopy and the atmosphere. In doing so CANOAK
computes the canopy microclimate (light, wind, temperature, humidity and
CO2), which provides drivers for physiological processes such as photosynthesis,
respiration, transpiration and stomatal conductance. The canopy is divided into
40 layers and at each layer the energy balance, photosynthesis, transpiration,
stomatal conductance and respiration of sunlit and shaded leaves is computed.
Stomatal conductance is computed using a model that is linked to photosynthesis.


The mechanistic and biochemical photosynthesis model of Farquhar is used to scale
leaf CO2 exchange to the canopy.

Stomatal conductance is computed using the Ball-Berry routine, that
is dependent on leaf photosynthesis, relative humidity and the
CO2 concentration at the leaf's surface.

Photosynthesis and stomatal conductance are computed using a
cubic analytical solution I developed from the coupled models
during my stay in Viterbo, 92/93 (Baldocchi, 1994).

Photosynthetic parameters (Vcmax and Jmax) are scaled
with height according to specific leaf weight. SLW is a
surrogate for the effect of leaf nitrogen on these parameters.
Kinetic photosynthetic coefficients are derived from Peter
Harley's 1992 field measurements at WBW. For the seasonal runs Vcmax and
Jmax are scaled to seasonal changes in leaf area index.

This model calculates isoprene emissions from the forest canopy using
algorithms by Guenther.

Turbulent diffusion is based on Lagrangian theory. A dispersion matrix is
calculated from the random walk algorithm of Thomson (from program MOVTHM.C).
The dispersion matrix is scaled according to u*. The dispersion matrix also
scales with stability, since it is dependent on sigma w and sigma w depends on z/L.
Dispersion matrices's functional dependence on stability have been derived by
regression against 5 stability classes.

Light profiles are computed on the basis of layers with constant
DELTA Z to be compatible with the meteorological model. Clumping of
foliage is consider via use of the Markov model for the probability
of beam penetration. The penetration and scattering routines of Norman (1979) are
used, these use a slab, one dimensional 'adding' method for scattering.
The probability of sunlit leaf area is computed using the
Markov model which introduces a clumping factor to the
Poisson eq.


Feedbacks are considered between the source sink function,
which is a function of C, and the dispersed concentration field,
which is a function of sources and sinks.

Solar elevation is computed with the algorithm of Welgraven

Soil energy balance and heat fluxes are computed using a
numerical solution to the Fourier heat transfer equation.
after Campbell.

Analytical (quadratic) solutions are used for the leaf and soil surface energy balances

Overall the model requires simple environmental inputs. Solar
radiation, wind speed, air temperature, humidity, CO2 and a
deep 32 cm soil temperature, at least, are needed to calculate
fluxes. Of course parameters describing leaf area, height and
physiological capacity of the vegetation are needed, but these
are canopy specific.


This version computes fluxes over the course of an annual cycle using hourly
data from Walker Branch Watershed. Inputs include meteorological data and seasonal
adjustment of leaf area index and photosynthetic capacity. Respiration and electron
transport rates are scaled with Vcmax, which is a function of leaf nitrogen and depth
in the canopy.

DEBUGGING NOTES

July 2019, Matthias Cuntz
Final debugging of Fortran version -> only very few time steps that are slightly different between Fortran and C

2017-2018, Yuan Yan
Debugged Fortran version -> root profile was calculated negative but became positive later

2011, Matthias Cuntz
Rewrote model in Fortran

2008, Matthias Cuntz
Debugged soil water and water isotopes

October 2007, Matthias Cuntz, Alexander Knohl
  - included water cycle
    % interception water
    % soil water (optional)
    % litter water (optional)
  - included water isotopes (optional)
    % ISOLSM - but changed percolation in soil, and changed surface fluxes
  - update 13C-formulation
  - LAI input file (optional)
  - photosynthetic parameter in two canopy layers (optional)
  - new parameter file format
  - only C (no C++), C99 standard; tested on Microsoft Visual C++ and GCC compilers
    the gcc call is: gcc -O3 -lm -x c -std=c99 -o caniso canisotope_v3.4.cpp

September 2006, Alexander Knohl
leaf photosynthesis and stomata conductance is now calculated from an analytical solution of the Farquhar model for
photosynthesis including mesophyll conductance and the Leuning Ball Berry equation for stomata conductance

August 2006, Alexander Knohl
diffuse radiation can either be calculated or can come from measurements (input file). Have to check diffuse radiation
routine since modelled diffuse radiation does not fit well with measurements.

August 2006, Alexander Knohl
ustar and z/L are now calculated based on actual measurement height, canopy height, displacement height and roughness length, not fixed parameters

Jan 2006, Alexander Knohl
soil temperature are now initiatlised with soil temperature from last time step (memory effect)

Sept 2005, Alexander Knohl
new routines for soil water added (based on LSM)

7-6-2004, Alexander Knohl
Parameter are read in from external file (parameter_file) in same directory. These parameters overwrite default values.
source code is changed from C to C++ (*.c to *.cpp) to allow object oriented programming.

12-5-2002
Changed Dispersion matrix to account for the exponential decrease in sigma w and to use
the Tl model of Massman and Weil, which considers canopy structure better. It produces a profile
of Tl that increase with depth, like my data, and produces a relatively constant length scale.
This makes better sense as L in the canopy is large and scales with the canopy shear length scale,
eg h, and is representative of large scale coherent eddies.

7-15-2002. Need to consider diffusion of 13C across the boundary layer, explicitly.

Found I am using constant diffusivities, irrespective of temperature and pressure, based on
data from Monteith and Unsworth at 20 C.

Modified code and adopt reference values of Massman (1998) and am correcting diffusivities for
temperature and pressure

added diffuse_par/par as an output

4-18-2002. Ready to submit paper to journal, but noticed some inconsistancies with R= C13/(C12+C13).
Also found an error in pdb_CO2. It is 0.01115, not 0.011115. New version has been tested and with
proper changes, there was only a small change in values. Keeling plot intercept even improved.

3-28-2002 calling measured CO2 at 44 m on D196
evaluating del 13C with different functions for day and night
found algebraic error in recycling calculation

3-26-2002. I think the signs may be wrong for Fiso. To be consistent with the up and down direction
of fluxes I am introducing (-)Acan into Fiso

3-25-2002. Need to average daily Ps for periods when it is not zero. Also computing daily
ave disc13.

2-28-2002 Found new calcs of recycle are inconsistant with old files. Need to average the layer
by layer calculations. Now having problems trying to find best way to express it and interpret
variables in the Yakir and Sternberg Eq.

2-26- 2002 Sensitivity run with sigma0 =0.3 rather than 0.15 on Dispersion matrix

2-18-2002 Running with CO2 = 370 ppm based on day values of Bowling, rather than 360

12-12-2001 Turn off soil respiration; *.resp

12-6-2001 Sensitivity Run with Vcmax set at 50 umol m-2 s-1

11/19/2001 Making sure changes to Cansens_v2 have been made to this code.

found error in Dij function. It should be f=(a+x)/(b+c x)

6-25-2001 Added the Daaman and Simmonds convection effects to soil resistances.
Also keeping rh at soil surface too high. Using RH of air to deduce if the soil
surface may be wet. Then vpdfact=1, else 0.1, like the Canpond simulations.

Found unit error in the vpd at the soil. Plus it was using the ea at the top of the canopy
rather than near the soil, as a reference value. Also we need to adjust the vpdsoil factor
for wet and dry soils. I am assuming the soil is wet if RH is above some level, eg 95%.
Then vpdfact is one. Otherwise the vpdfact is 0.1, like the test for the Pipo in Oregon.

6-23-2001. Need to incorporate Daaman and Simmons routines for soil resistances, like
Canpond. At present soil evaporation is too large during the winter. Thought I had put these
routines in, but did not.

6-25-2001. Sorted out the PS root problem and found some errors on the soil evaporation
routine. Had wrong units and wrong variable for soil Energy balance. Also added Daamen
and Simmons routine to soil energy. Need to fix this code yet.

6/17/2001. Fixed minor LAI profiling error
Incorporated changes in the Photosynthesis routine catch the right roots

6/7/2001: Be careful. Getting obscenely large Ps values with new root correction

4/12/2001 Fixed conditional statement in PS().
Was: if (ROOT1=ROOT2).
Fixed to: if (ROOT1==ROOT2)


add recycling to profiles; these need debugging or need to be dropped as
negative values occur and I am not considering the transfer of air from above
correctly

4/11/2001

Adding computations of recycling of Co2 according to Sternberg

3/29/2001

Code is compute photosynthesis weighted disc13 and the Keeling int are agreeing with data
from Bowling.

Computing fraction of air from soil

3/23/2001

Compute Flux weighted disc13

Computing what the assimilated discrimination, R, was to use to respire the next day
to assess the isotope discrimination of the respired CO2

3/21/2001

The current version gives a linear Keeling plot and the intercept is -26 per mill
the soil value!!


3/20/2001 Bole.resp was in mg m-2 s-1 and was being added to the source which
I had converted to umol m-2 s-1. I was also not converting the bole respiration
to 13C fluxes. This may be one reason Isotopes were getting screwed up in the canopy

3/13/2001 Redoing the Dij using the algorithm of Massman and Weil. Recomputed
Dij function for z/L

Debugging ISOTOPE and CONC

found that I needed to adjust the CO2 profile by the factor ma/mc rhoair_mole_m-3
to convert from mole -3 to umol

Need to make sure 13C and 12C or (12C + 13C) cancel.

3/12/2001 Got Isotope model running


2-23-2001 add info on wj and wc profiles

1-7-2001

found met.zl was set to zero in CONC for neutral run of dispersion matrix. need to
turn it off here and in canoak!

1-2-2001
Be careful on reading data with C++ compiler. I was getting warning
errors using floats, so I changed everything to double. When I did this
the input structure and Dispersion matrices were read in as garbage.
I had to change those variables back to float and then they read ok!

NEED TO BE CAREFUL ON ISOTOPES AS MANY OF THE CO2 SOURCE SINKS WERE
IN UNITS OF MG M-2 S-1. WANT TO BE IN UNITS OF MICROMOLES M-2 S-1

NEED TO ASSIGN RS TO F(PAR) ONLY THE FIRST ITERATION ON SUN AND
SHADE LEAVES. AT PRESENT IT IS BEING RESET TO F(PAR) EVERY
LOOP

12-28-2000

converting global variables over to structures
